# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

a. Scan infrastructure as code templates
- Checkov scans IaC templates (Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Kubernetes, etc.) for security misconfigurations and compliance violations.
- Example Compliance Violation or Vulnerability: Detects an insecure security group configuration in a Terraform template that allows unrestricted inbound access (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0) to all ports, exposing the cloud infrastructure to potential attacks.

b. Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
- Aqua Security scans container images and AMIs for vulnerabilities in the base OS and application dependencies, helping to identify outdated or vulnerable packages.
- Example Compliance Violation or Vulnerability: Detects that an AMI contains an outdated version of Apache with a critical vulnerability (e.g., CVE-2021-41773) that could allow remote code execution.

c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
- AWS Config continuously monitors and evaluates your AWS resources for compliance with best practices and security policies, identifying configuration vulnerabilities.
- Example Compliance Violation or Vulnerability: Detects an S3 bucket configured with public read/write access, which could lead to unauthorized data exposure or modification, violating security best practices.
